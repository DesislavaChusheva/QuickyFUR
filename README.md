# QuickyFUR
ASP.NET First Project - Web App for configurable furniture

QuickyFUR is a platform in which furniture designers present their products, and customers have the opportunity to order a product in the most suitable option for them. This is possible because the designer provides access to a configurator located on the ShapeDiver platform for each of his products.
Behind the configurator of each model is a .gh file. (Definitions of demo products will be displayed and explained during the defense of the QuickyFUR project).
In the current version of QuickyFUR, after the customer configures the product of his choice, he downloads a file from ShapeDiver, which he must apply when finalizing his order (The download button is located in the second tab of the configuration menu).
Subsequent development of QuickyFUR envisages automation of the data transfer process between the two platforms. This will improve the user experience and prevent unwanted file interference.

When registering in the QuickyFUR platform, the user selects his role, then applies additional information to his account. Users have the opportunity to make adjustments to the basic and additional information about them.
Designers can create, modify delete and view their products. They can also see the orders made for their products, sorted by customers.
Customers can browse products by category and view additional information about the designer of a selected product, along with all of his products. When selecting a product, the customer configures it, downloads the file from ShapeDiver and attaches it to the product order in QuickyFUR. After adding the configured product to the cart, it can always be removed. When the products from the cart are purchased, the cart is emptied and the orders can be seen, sorted by designers.
